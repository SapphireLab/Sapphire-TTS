# Encodec: High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression

## Abstract

> We introduce a state-of-the-art real-time, high-fidelity, audio codec leveraging neural networks.
> It consists in a streaming encoder-decoder architecture with quantized latent space trained in an end-to-end fashion.
> We simplify and speed-up the training by using a single multiscale spectrogram adversary that efficiently reduces artifacts and produce high-quality samples.
> We introduce a novel loss balancer mechanism to stabilize training: the weight of a loss now defines the fraction of the overall gradient it should represent, thus decoupling the choice of this hyper-parameter from the typical scale of the loss.
> Finally, we study how lightweight Transformer models can be used to further compress the obtained representation by up to 40%, while staying faster than real time.
> We provide a detailed description of the key design choices of the proposed model including: training objective, architectural changes and a study of various perceptual loss functions.
> We present an extensive subjective evaluation (MUSHRA tests) together with an ablation study for a range of bandwidths and audio domains, including speech, noisy-reverberant speech, and music.
> Our approach is superior to the baselines methods across all evaluated settings, considering both 24 kHz monophonic and 48 kHz stereophonic audio.
> Code and models are available at github.com/facebookresearch/encodec.


## 1.Introduction

> Recent studies suggest that streaming audio and video have accounted for the majority of the internet traffic in 2021 (82% according to (Cisco, 2021)).
> With the internet traffic expected to grow, audio compression is an increasingly important problem.
> In lossy signal compression we aim at minimizing the bitrate of a sample while also minimizing the amount of distortion according to a given metric, ideally correlated with human perception.
> Audio codecs typically employ a carefully engineered pipeline combining an encoder and a decoder to remove redundancies in the audio content and yield a compact bitstream.
> Traditionally, this is achieved by decomposing the input with a signal processing transform and trading off the quality of the components that are less likely to influence perception.
> Leveraging neural networks as trained transforms via an encoder-decoder mechanism has been explored by Morishima et al.(1990); Rippel et al.(2019); Zeghidour et al.(2021).
> Our research work is in the continuity of this line of work, with a focus on audio signals.

> The problems arising in lossy neural compression models are twofold: first, the model has to represent a wide range of signals, such as not to overfit the training set or produce artifact laden audio outside its comfort zone.
> We solve this by having a large and diverse training set (described in Section 4.1), as well as discriminator networks (see Section 3.4) that serve as perceptual losses, which we study extensively in Section 4.5.1, Table 2.
> The other problem is that of compressing efficiently, both in compute time and in size.
> For the former, we limit ourselves to models that run in real-time on a single CPU core.
> For the latter, we use residual vector quantization of the neural encoder floating-point output, for which various approaches have been proposed (Van Den Oord et al., 2017; Zeghidour et al., 2021).

> Accompanying those technical contributions, we posit that designing end-to-end neural compression models is a set of intertwined choices, among which at least the encoder-decoder architecture, the quantization method, and the perceptual loss play key parts.
> Objective evaluations exist and we report scores on them in our ablations (Section 4.5.1).
> But the evaluation of lossy audio codecs necessarily relies on human perception, so we ran extensive human evaluation for multiple points in this design space, both for speech and music.
> Those evaluations (MUSHRA) consist in having humans listen to, compare, and rate excerpts of speech or music compressed with competitive codecs and variants of our method, and the uncompressed ground truth.
> This allows to compare variants of the whole pipeline in isolation, as well as their combined effect, in Section 4.5.1 (Figure 3 and Table 1).
> Finally, our best model, **EnCodec** , reaches state-of-the-art scores for speech and for music at 1.5, 3, 6, 12 kbps at 24 kHz, and at 6, 12, and 24 kbps for 48 kHz with stereo channels.

## 2.Related Work

### Speech and Audio Synthesis

> Recent advancements in neural audio generation enabled computers to efficiently generate natural sounding audio.
> The first convincing results were achieved by autoregressive models such as [WaveNet (2016)](Vocoders/2016.09_WaveNet.md), at the cost of slow inference.
> While many other approaches were explored (Yamamoto et al., 2020a; Kalchbrenner et al., 2018; Goel et al., 2022), the most relevant ones here are those based on [Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)]() (Kumar et al., 2019; Yamamoto et al., 2020a; Kong et al., 2020; Andreev et al., 2022) were able to match the quality of autoregressive by combining various adversarial networks operate at different multi-scale and multi-period resolutions.
> Our work uses and extends similar adversarial losses to limit artifacts during audio generation.

### Audio Codec

> Low bitrate parametric speech and audio codecs have long been studied (Atal & Hanauer, 1971; Juang & Gray, 1982), but their quality has been severely limited.
> Despite some advances (Griffin & Lim, 1985; McCree et al., 1996), modeling the excitation signal has remained a challenging task.
> The current state-of-the-art traditional audio codecs are Opus (Valin et al., 2012) and Enhanced Voice Service (EVS) (Dietz et al., 2015).
> These methods produce high coding efficiency for general audio while supporting various bitrates, sampling rates, and real-time compression.

> Neural based audio codecs have been recently proposed and demonstrated promising results (Kleijn et al., 2018; Valin & Skoglund, 2019b; Lim et al., 2020; Kleijn et al., 2021; Zeghidour et al., 2021; Omran et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022; Jayashankar et al., 2022; Li et al.; Jiang et al., 2022), where most methods are based on quantizing the latent space before feeding it to the decoder.
> In Valin & Skoglund (2019b), an LPCNet (Valin & Skoglund, 2019a) vocoder was conditioned on hand-crafted features and a uniform quantizer.
> Gârbacea et al. (2019) conditioned a WaveNet based model on discrete units obtained from a VQ-VAE (Van Den Oord et al., 2017; Razavi et al., 2019) model, while Skoglund & Valin (2019) tried feeding the Opus codec (Valin et al., 2012) to a WaveNet to further improve its perceptual quality.
> Jayashankar et al. (2022); Jiang et al. (2022) propose an auto-encoder with a vector quantization layer applied over the latent representation and minimizing the reconstruction loss, while Li et al. suggested using Gumbel-Softmax (GS) (Jang et al., 2017) for representation quantization.
> The most relevant related work to ours is the SoundStream model (Zeghidour et al., 2021), in which the authors propose a fully convolutional encoder decoder architecture with a Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) (Gray, 1984; Vasuki & Vanathi, 2006) layers.
> The model was optimized using both reconstruction loss and adversarial perceptual losses.

### Audio Discretization

> Representing audio and speech using discrete values was proposed to various tasks recently.
> Dieleman et al. (2018); Dhariwal et al. (2020) proposed a hierarchical VQ-VAE based model for learning discrete representation of raw audio, next combined with an auto-regressive model, demonstrating the ability to generate high quality music.Similarly, Lakhotia et al. (2021); Kharitonov et al. (2021) demonstrated that self-supervised learning methods for speech (e.g., HuBERT (Hsu et al., 2021)), can be quantized and used for conditional and unconditional speech generation.
> Similar methods were applied to speech resynthesis (Polyak et al., 2021), speech emotion conversion (Kreuk et al., 2021), spoken dialog system (Nguyen et al., 2022), and speech-to-speech translation (Lee et al., 2021a;b; Popuri et al., 2022).

## 3.Model

> An audio signal of duration d can be represented by a sequence $\mathbf{x}\in[−1,1]^{C_a\times T}$ with $C_a$ the number of audio channels, $T=d \cdot f_{sr}$ the number of audio samples at a given sample rate $f_{sr}$.
> The **EnCodec** model is composed of three main components: 
> 1. First, an encoder network $E$ is input an audio extract and outputs a latent representation $\mathbf{z}$;
> 2. Next, a quantization layer $Q$ produces a compressed representation $\mathbf{z}_q$, using vector quantization; 
> 3. Lastly, a decoder network $G$ reconstructs the time-domain signal, $\hat{\mathbf{x}}$, from the compressed latent representation $\mathbf{z}_q$.
> The whole system is trained end-to-end to minimize a reconstruction loss applied over both time and frequency domain, together with a perceptual loss in the form of discriminators operating at different resolutions.
> A visual description of the proposed method can be seen in Fig.1.

### 3.1.Encoder & Decoder Architecture 

> The **EnCodec** model is a simple streaming, convolutional-based encoder-decoder architecture with sequential modeling component applied over the latent representation, both on the encoder and on the decoder side.
> Such modeling framework was shown to provide great results in various audio-related tasks, e.g., source separation and enhancement (Défossez et al., 2019; Defossez et al., 2020), neural vocoders (Kumar et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2020), audio codec (Zeghidour et al., 2021), and artificial bandwidth extension (Tagliasacchi et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021).
> We use the same architecture for 24 kHz and 48 kHz audio.

#### Encoder-Decoder

> The encoder model $E$ consists in a 1D convolution with $C$ channels and a kernel size of 7 followed by $B$ convolution blocks.
> Each convolution block is composed of a single residual unit followed by a down-sampling layer consisting in a strided convolution, with a kernel sizeKof twice the strideS.
> The residual unit contains two convolutions with kernel size 3 and a skip-connection.
> The number of channels is doubled whenever down-sampling occurred.
> The convolution blocks are followed by a two-layer LSTM for sequence modeling and a final 1D convolution layer with a kernel size of 7 and $D$ output channels.
> Following Zeghidour et al. (2021); Li et al. (2021), we use $C= 32$, $B=4$ and $(2, 4, 5, 8)$ as strides.
> We use ELU as a non-linear activation function (Clevert et al., 2015) either layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) or weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016).
> We use two variants of the model, depending on whether we target the low-latency streamable setup, or a high fidelity non-streamable usage.
> With this setup, the encoder outputs 75 latent steps per second of audio at 24 kHz, and 150 at 48 kHz.
> The decoder mirrors the encoder, using transposed convolutions instead of strided convolutions, and with the strides in reverse order as in the encoder, outputting the final mono or stereo audio.

#### Non-streamable

> In the non-streamable setup, we use for each convolution a total padding of $K−S$, split equally before the first time step and after the last one (with one more before if $K−S$ is odd).
> We further split the input into chunks of 1 seconds, with an overlap of 10 ms to avoid clicks, and normalize each chunk before feeding it to the model, applying the inverse operation on the output of the decoder, adding a negligible bandwidth overhead to transmit the scale.
> We use layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016), computing the statistics including also the time dimension in order to keep the relative scale information.

#### Streamable

> For the streamable setup, all padding is put before the first time step.
> For a transposed convolution with stride $s$, we output the $s$ first time steps, and keep the remaining $s$ steps in memory for completion when the next frame is available, or discarding it at the end of a stream.
> Thanks to this padding scheme, the model can output 320 samples (13 ms) as soon as the first 320 samples (13 ms) are received.
> We replace the layer normalization with statistics computed over the time dimension with weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016), as the former is ill-suited for a streaming setup.
> We notice a small gain over the objective metrics by keeping a form of normalization, as demonstrated in Tab.A.3.

### 3.2.Residual Vector Quantization 

> We use Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to quantize the output of the encoder as introduced by Zeghidour et al. (2021).
> Vector quantization consists in projecting an input vector onto the closest entry in a codebook of a given size.
> RVQ refines this process by computing the residual after quantization, and further quantizing it using a second codebook, and so forth.

> We follow the same training procedure as described by Dhariwal et al. (2020) and Zeghidour et al. (2021).
> The codebook entry selected for each input is updated using an exponential moving average with a decay of 0.99, and entries that are not used are replaced with a candidate sampled from the current batch.
> We use a straight-through-estimator (Bengio et al., 2013) to compute the gradient of the encoder, e.g. as if the quantization step was the identity function during the backward phase.
> Finally, a commitment loss, consisting of the MSE between the input of the quantizer and its output, with gradient only computed with respect to its input, is added to the overall training loss.

> By selecting a variable number of residual steps at train time, a single model can be used to support multiple bandwidth target (Zeghidour et al., 2021).
> For all of our models, we use at most 32 codebooks (16 for the 48 kHz models) with 1024 entries each, e.g. 10 bits per codebook.
> When doing variable bandwidth training, we select randomly a number of codebooks as a multiple of 4, i.e. corresponding to a bandwidth 1.5, 3, 6, 12 or 24 kbps at 24 kHz.
> Given a continuous latent represention with shape [B, D, T] that comes out of the encoder, this procedure turns it into a discrete set of indexes [B, Nq, T] withNqthe number of codebooks selected.
> This discrete representation can changed again to a vector by summing the corresponding codebook entries, which is done just before going into the decoder.

### 3.3.Language Modeling and Entropy Coding 

> We additionally train a small Transformer based language model (Vaswani et al., 2017) with the objective of keeping faster than real time end-to-end compression/decompression on a single CPU core.
> The model consists of 5 layers, 8 heads, 200 channels, a dimension of 800 for the feed-forward blocks, and no dropout.
> At train time, we select a bandwidth and the corresponding number of codebooksNq.
> For a time stept, the discrete representation obtained at timet −1 is transformed into a continuous representation using learnt embedding tables, one for each codebook, and which are summed.
> Fort= 0, a special token is used instead.
> The output of the Transformer is fed intoNqlinear layers with as many output channels as the cardinality of each codebook (e.g.
> 1024), giving us the logits of the estimated distribution over each codebook for timet.
> We thus neglect potential mutual information between the codebooks at a single time step.
> This allows to speedup inference (as opposed to having one time step per codebook, or a multi-stage prediction) with a limited impact over the final cross entropy.
> Each attention layer has a causal receptive field of 3.5 seconds,.

> and we offset by a random amount the initial position of the sinusoidal position embedding to emulate being in a longer sequence.
> We train the model on sequences of 5 seconds.

#### Entropy Encoding

> We use a range based arithmetic coder (Pasco, 1976; Rissanen & Langdon, 1981) in order to leverage the estimated probabilities given by the language model.
> As noted by Ballé et al. (2018), evaluation of the same model might lead to different results on different architectures, or with different evaluation procedures due to floating point approximations.
> This can lead to decoding errors as the encoder and decoder will not use the exact same code.
> We observe in particular that the difference between batch evaluation (e.g.
> all time steps at once), and the real-life streaming evaluation that occurs in the decoder can lead to difference larger than 10−8.
> We first round the estimated probabilities with a precision of 10−6, although evaluations in more contexts would be needed for practical deployment.
> We use a total range width of 224, and assign a minimum range width of 2.
> We discuss the impact on the processing time in Section 4.6.

### 3.4.Training objective 

> We detail the training objective that combines a reconstruction loss term, a perceptual loss term (via discriminators), and the RVQ commitment loss.

#### Reconstruction Loss

> The reconstruction loss term is comprised of a time and a frequency domain loss term.
> We minimize the L1 distance between the target and compressed audio over the time domain, i.e. $l_t(\mathbf{x}, \hat{\mathbf{x}})=\|\mathbf{x}-\hat{\mathbf{x}}\|_1$.
> For the frequency domain, we use a linear combination between the L1 and L2 losses over the mel-spectrogram using several time scales (Yamamoto et al., 2020b; Gritsenko et al., 2020).
> Formally, ‘f(x, ˆx) =1 |α| · |s|X αi∈α X i∈e kSi(x) − Si(ˆx)k1+ αikSi(x) − Si(ˆx)k2,(1) whereSiis a 64-bins mel-spectrogram using a normalized STFT with window size of 2iand hop length of 2i/4,e=5, .., 11is the set of scales, andαrepresents the set of scalar coefficients balancing between the L1 and L2 terms.
> Unlike Gritsenko et al. (2020), we take αi= 1.

#### Discriminative Loss

> To further improve the quality of the generated samples, we introduce a perceptual loss term based on a multi-scale STFT-based (MS-STFT) discriminator, illustrated in Figure 2.
> Multi scale discriminators are popular for capturing different structures in audio signals (Kumar et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2020; You et al., 2021).
> The MS-STFT discriminator consists in identically structured networks operating on multi-scaled complex-valued STFT with the real and imaginary parts concatenated.
> Each sub-network is composed of a 2D convolutional layer (using kernel size 3 x 8 with 32 channels), followed by 2D convolutions with increasing dilation rates in the time dimension of 1, 2 and 4, and a stride of 2 over the frequency axis.
> A final 2D convolution with kernel size 3 x 3 and stride (1, 1) provide the final prediction.
> We use 5 different scales with STFT window lengths of [2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128].
> For 48 kHz audio, we double the size of each STFT window and train the discriminator every two batches, and for stereophonic audio, we process separately the left and right channels.
> We use LeakyReLU as a no weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016) to our discriminator network.
> The MS-STFT discriminator model architecture is visually depicted in Figure 2.
> The adversarial loss for the generator is constructed as follows,‘g(ˆx) =1 KPkmax(0,1−Dk(ˆx))), whereKis the number of discriminators.
> Similarly to previous work on neural vocoders (Kumar et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2020; You et al., 2021), we additionally include a relative feature matching loss for the generator.
> Formally, ‘feat(x, ˆx) =1 KL K X k=1 L X l=1 kDlk(x) − Dlk(ˆx)k1 mean�kDlk(x)k1� ,(2) where themeanis computed over all dimensions, (Dk) are the discriminators, andLis the number of layers in discriminators.
> The discriminators are trained to minimize the following hinge-loss adversarial loss function: Ld(x, ˆx) =1 KPKk=1max(0,1− Dk(x)) +max(0,1 +Dk(ˆx)), whereKis the number of discriminators.
> Given that the discriminator tend to overpower easily the decoder, we update its weight with a probability of 2/3 at 24 kHz, and 0.5 at 48 kHz.

#### Multi-bandwidth training

> At 24 kHz, we train the model to support the bandwidths 1.5, 3, 6, 12, and 24 kbps by selecting the appropriate number of codebooks to keep in the RVQ step, as explained in Section 3.2.
> At 48 kHz, we train to support 3, 6, 12 and 24 kbps.
> We also noticed that using a dedicated discriminator per-bandwidth is beneficial to the audio quality.
> Thus, we select a given bandwidth for the entire batch, and evaluate and update only the corresponding discriminator.

#### VQ commitment loss

> As mentioned in Section 3.2, we add a commitment losslwbetween the output of the encoder, and its quantized value, with no gradient being computed for the quantized value.
> For each residual stepc ∈ {1, ..C}(withCdepeding on the bandwidth target for the current batch), notingzcthe current residual and qc(zc) the nearest entry in the corresponding codebook, we define lwas lw= C X c=1 kzc− qc(zc)k22.(3) Overall, the generator is trained to optimize the following loss, summed over the batch, LG= λt· ‘t(x, ˆx) + λf· ‘f(x, ˆx) + λg· ‘g(ˆx) + λfeat· ‘feat(x, ˆx) + λw· ‘w(w),(4) where λt, λf, λg, λfeat, and λwthe scalar coefficients to balance between the terms.

#### Balancer

> We introduce a loss balancer in order to stabilize training, in particular the varying scale of the gradients coming from the discriminators.
> We also find that the balancer makes it easier to reason about the different loss weights, independently of their scale.
> Let us take a number of losses (‘i)ithat depends only on the output of the modelˆx.
> We definegi=∂‘i ∂ˆx, andhkgik2iβthe exponential moving average ofgiover the last training batches.
> Given a set of weights (λi) and a reference norm R, we define ˜gi= Rλi Pjλj· gi hkgik2iβ.(5) We then backpropagate into the networkPi˜gi, instead of the originalPiλigi.
> This changes the optimization problem but allows to make theλiinterpretable irrespectively of the natural scale of each loss.
> IfPiλi= 1, then each weight can be interpreted as the fraction of the model gradient that come from the corresponding loss.
> We takeR= 1 andβ= 0.999.
> All the generator losses from Eq. (4) fit into the balancer, except for the commitment loss, as it is not defined with respect to the output of the model.


## 4.Experiments and Results 

### 4.1.Dataset 

> We train **EnCodec** on 24 kHz monophonic across diverse domains, namely: speech, noisy speech, music and general audio while we train the fullband stereo **EnCodec** on only 48 kHz music.
> For speech, we use the clean speech segments from DNS Challenge 4 (Dubey et al., 2022) and the Common Voice dataset (Ardila et al., 2019).
> For general audio, we use on AudioSet (Gemmeke et al., 2017) together with FSD50K (Fonseca et al., 2021).
> For music, we rely on the Jamendo dataset (Bogdanov et al., 2019) for training and evaluation and we further evaluate our models on music using a proprietary music dataset.
> Data splits are detailed in Appendix A.1.

> For training and validation, we define a mixing strategy which consists in either sampling a single source from a dataset or performing on the fly mixing of two or three sources.
> Specifically, we have four strategies: (s1) we sample a single source from Jamendo with probability 0.32; (s2) we sample a single source from the other datasets with the same probability; (s3) we mix two sources from all datasets with a probability of 0.24; (s4) we mix three sources from all datasets except music with a probability of 0.12.

> The audio is normalized by file and we apply a random gain between -10 and 6 dB.
> We reject any sample that has been clipped.
> Finally we add reverberation using room impulse responses provided by the DNS challenge with probability 0.2, and RT60 in the range [0.3, 1.3] except for the single-source music samples.
> For testing, we use four categories: clean speech from DNS alone, clean speech mixed with FSDK50K sample, Jamendo sample alone, proprietary music sample alone.

### 4.2. Baselines
> Opus (Valin et al., 2012) is a versatile speech and audio codec standardized by the IETF in 2012.
> It scales from 6 kbps narrowband monophonic audio to 510 kbps fullband stereophonic audio.
> EVS (Dietz et al., 2015) is a codec standardized in 2014 by 3GPP and developed for Voice over LTE (VoLTE).
> It supports a range of bitrates from 5.9 kbps to 128 kbps, and audio bandwidths from 4 kHz to 20 kHz.
> It is the successor of AMR-WB (Bhagat et al., 2012).We use both codecs to serve as traditional digital signal processing baselines.
> We also utilize MP3 compression at 64 kbps as an additional baseline for the stereophonic signal compression case.
> MP3 uses lossy data compression by approximating the accuracy of certain components of sound that are considered to be beyond hearing capabilities of most humans.
> Finally, we compare **EnCodec** to the SoundStream model from the official implementation available in Lyra 21at 3.2 kbps and 6 kbps on audio upsampled to 32 kHz.
> We also reproduced a version of SoundStream (Zeghidour et al., 2021) with minor improvements.
> Namely, we use the relative feature loss introduce in Section 3.4, and layer normalization (applied separately for each time step) in the discriminators, except for the first and last layer, which improved the audio quality during our preliminary studies.
> Results a reported in Table A.2 in the Appendix A.3.

### 4.3. Evaluation Methods
> We consider both subjective and objective evaluation metrics.
> For the subjective tests we follow the MUSHRA protocol (Series, 2014), using both a hidden reference and a low anchor.
> Annotators were recruited using a crowd-sourcing platform, in which they were asked to rate the perceptual quality of the provided samples in a range between 1 to 100.
> We randomly select 50 samples of 5 seconds from each category of the the test set and force at least 10 annotations per samples.
> To filter noisy annotations and outliers we remove annotators who rate the reference recordings less then 90 in at least 20% of the cases, or rate the low-anchor recording above 80 more than 50% of the time.
> For objective metrics, we use ViSQOL (Hines et al., 2012; Chinen et al., 2020)2, together with the Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Noise Ration (SI-SNR) (Luo & Mesgarani, 2019; Nachmani et al., 2020; Chazan et al., 2021).

### 4.4. Training 

> We train all models for 300 epochs, with one epoch being 2,000 updates with the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 64 examples of 1 second each, a learning rate of 3·10−4,β1= 0.5, andβ2= 0.9.
> All the models are traind using 8 A100 GPUs.
> We use the balancer introduced in Section 3.4 with weightsλt= 0.1,λf= 1, λg= 3, λfeat= 3 for the 24 kHz models.
> For the 48 kHz model, we use instead λg= 4, λfeat= 4.

### 4.5.Results 

> We start with the results for **EnCodec** with a bandwidth in{1.5,3,6,12}kbps and compare them to the baselines.
> Results for the streamable setup are reported in Figure 3 and a breakdown per category in Table 1.
> We additionally explored other quantizers such as Gumbel-Softmax and DiffQ (see details in Appendix A.2), however, we found in preliminary results that they provide similar or worse results, hence we do not report them.
> When considering the same bandwidth, **EnCodec** is superior to all evaluated baselines considering the MUSHRA score.
> Notice, **EnCodec** at 3kbps reaches better performance on average than Lyra-v2 using 6kbps and Opus at 12kbps.
> When considering the additional language model over the codes, we can reduce the bandwidth by∼25−40%.
> For instance, we can reduce the bandwidth of the 3 kpbs model to 1.9 kbps.
> We observe that for higher bandwidth, the compression ratio is lower, which could be explained by the small size of the Transformer model used, making hard to model all codebooks together.

#### 4.5.1.Ablation study 

> Next, we perform an ablation study to better evaluate the effect of the discriminator setup, streaming, multi target bandwidth, and balancer.
> We provide more detailed ablation studies in the Appendix, Section A.3.

##### The effect of discriminators setup

> Various discriminators were proposed in prior work to improve the perceptual quality of the generated audio.
> The Multi-Scale Discriminator (MSD) model proposed by Kumar et al. (2019) and adopted in (Kong et al., 2020; Andreev et al., 2022; Zeghidour et al., 2021), operates on the raw waveform at different resolutions.
> We adopt the same MSD configuration as described in Zeghidour et al. (2021).
> Kong et al. (2020) additionally propose the Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) model, which reshapes the waveform to a 2D input with multiple periods.
> Next, the STFT Discriminator (Mono-STFTD) model was introduced in Zeghidour et al. (2021), where a single network operates over the complex-valued STFT.
> We evaluate our MS-STFTD discriminator against three other discriminator configurations: (i) MSD+Mono STFTD (as in Zeghidour et al. (2021)); (ii) MPD only; (iii) MS-STFTD only; (vi) MS-STFTD+MPD.
> Results are reported in Table 2.
> Results suggest that using only a multi-scale STFT-based discriminator such as MS STFTD, is enough to generate high quality audio.
> Additionally, it simplifies the model training and reduces training time.
> Including the MPD discriminator, adds a small gain when considering the MUSHRA score.

##### The effect of the streamable modeling

> We also investigate streamable vs.
> non-streamable setups and report results in Table 3.
> Unsurprisingly, we notice a small degradation switching from non-streamable to streamable but the performance remains strong while this setting enables streaming inference.

##### The effect of the balancer

> Lastly, we present results evaluating the impact of the balancer.
> We train the  **EnCodec** model considering various valuesλt,λf,λg, andλfeatwith and without the balancer.
> Results are reported in Table A.4 in the Appendix.
> As expected, results suggest the balancer significantly stabilizes the training process.
> See Appendix A.3 for more details.

#### 4.5.2.Stereo Evaluation 

> All previously reported results considered only the monophonic setup.Although it makes sense when considering speech data, however for music data, stereo compression is highly important.
> We adjust our current setup to stereo by only modifying our discriminator setup as described in Section 3.4.
> Results for **EnCodec** working at 6 kbps, **EnCodec** with Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) at 6 kbps, and Opus at 6 kbps, and MP3 at 64 kbps are reported in Table 4.
> **EnCodec** is significantly outperforms Opus at 6kbps and is comparable to MP3 at 64kbps, while **EnCodec** at 12kpbs achieve comparable performance to **EnCodec** at 24kbps.
> Using a language model and entropy coding gives a variable gain between 20% to 30%.

### 4.6.Latency and computation time 

> We report the initial latency and real time factor on Table 5.
> The real-time factor is here defined as the ratio between the duration of the audio and the processing time, so that it is greater than one when the method is faster than real time.
> We profiled all models on a single thread of a MacBook Pro 2019 CPU at 6 kbps.

#### Initial latency

> The 24 kHz streaming  **EnCodec** model has an initial latency (i.e., without the computation time) of 13.3 ms.
> The 48 kHz non-streaming version has an initial latency of 1 second, due to the normalizations used.
> Note that using entropy coding increases the initial latency, because the stream cannot be “flushed”with each frame, in order to keep the overhead small.
> Thus decoding the frame at time t, requires for the frame t + 1 to be partially received, increasing the latency by 13ms.

#### Real time factor

> While our model is worse than Lyra v2 in term of processing speed, it processes the audio 10 times faster than real time, making it a good candidate for real life applications.
> The gain from the entropy coding comes at a cost, although the processing is still faster than real time and could be used for applications where latency is not essential (e.g.
> streaming).
> At 48 kHz, the increased number of step size lead to a slower than real time processing, although a more efficient implementation, or using accelerated hardware would improve the RTF.
> It could also be used for archiving where real time processing is not required.

## 5.Conclusion 

> We presented **EnCodec** : a state-of-the-art real-time neural audio compression model, producing high-fidelity audio samples across a range of sample rates and bandwidth.
> We showed subjective and objective results from 24kHz monophonic at 1.5 kbps (Figure 3) to 48kHz stereophonic (Table 4).
> We improved sample quality by developing a simple but potent spectrogram-only adversarial loss which efficiently reduces artifacts and produce high-quality samples.
> Besides, we stabilized training and improved the interpretability of the weights for losses through a novel gradient balancer.
> Finally, we also demonstrated that a small Transformer model can be used to further reduce the bandwidth by up to 40% without further degradation of quality, in particular for applications where low latency is not essential (e.g.
> music streaming).
