## Abstract·摘要

> Speech synthesis has made significant strides thanks to the transition from machine learning to deep learning models. 
> Contemporary **Text-To-Speech (TTS)** models possess the capability to generate speech of exceptionally high quality, closely mimicking human speech. Nevertheless, given the wide array of applications now employing TTS models, mere high-quality speech generation is no longer sufficient. 
> Present-day TTS models must also excel at producing expressive speech that can convey various speaking styles and emotions, akin to human speech. Consequently,researchers have concentrated their efforts on developing more efficient models for expressive speech synthesis in recent years. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on expressive speech synthesis models published within the last 5 years, with a particular emphasis on approaches based on deep learning. We offer a comprehensive classification scheme for these models and provide concise descriptions of models falling into each category.
> Additionally, we summarize the principal challenges encountered in this research domain and outline the strategies employed to tackle these challenges as documented in the literature. In the Section 8, we pinpoint some research gaps in this field that necessitate further exploration. Our objective with this work is to give an all-encompassing overview of this hot research area to offer guidance to interested researchers and future endeavors in this field.

语音合成技术因从机器学习到深度学习模型的转变而取得了显著进步.
当代的文本转语音模型能够生成质量极高的, 几乎媲美人类的语音. 
但是鉴于现在有众多应用正在采用文本转语音模型, 仅仅生成高质量的语音已经不再足够.
现今的文本转语音模型还必须擅长生成富有表现力的语音, 能够传达类似于人类语音的多种说话风格和情感.
因此, 近年来研究人员集中精力于开发更高效的富有表现力的语音合成模型.

本文对过去五年内发表的关于富有表现力的语音合成模型的文献进行了系统性的回顾, 特别关注基于深度学习的方法.
我们为这些模型提供了一个全面的分类方案, 并对每个类别中的模型进行了简要的描述.
此外, 我们总结了在这一研究领域遇到的主要挑战, 并概述了文献中记录的应对这些挑战的策略.

在第 8 节中, 我们指出了该领域中需要进一步探索的一些研究空白.

我们进行这项工作的目的是为这一热门研究领域提供一个全面的概述, 为对这一领域感兴趣的研究人员和未来研究提供指导.
